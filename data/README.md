This dataset contains 212 manually curated English word pairs designed for social deduction games such as “Who is Undercover” and “Spyfall.” The pairs are categorized into three difficulty levels based on semantic similarity: easy_keyword_pairs.json (72 pairs) – words are clearly different and easy to distinguish; medium_keyword_pairs.json (82 pairs) – words belong to the same category and require some real-world knowledge to tell apart; hard_keyword_pairs.json (58 pairs) – words are highly similar or near-synonyms, requiring detailed or background knowledge to differentiate. This dataset is suitable for tasks involving language model reasoning, deception-based gameplay simulation, multi-agent interaction, and dialogue-based evaluation.
